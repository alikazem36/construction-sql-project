Project Title: Construction Management Database
Objective: Create an SQL database to manage construction projects, tracking budgets, contractors, materials, employee schedules, and project progress.

1. BeBasic Database Design & Queries
Create tables using CREATE TABLE (e.g., Projects, Employees, Contractors, Materials, Tasks).
Insert sample data using INSERT INTO.
Retrieve basic data using SELECT.
Use WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT for simple queries.
Basic JOIN operations (e.g., list employees working on a specific project).

2. Advanced Queries & Data Integrity
Use FOREIGN KEY constraints for referential integrity.
Implement UPDATE and DELETE with conditions.
Perform aggregate operations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY).
Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
Stored Procedures for automating project cost calculations.
Triggers for data validation (e.g., preventing negative budgets).

3. Optimization, Security & Reporting
Indexing strategies for performance (CREATE INDEX).
Views for reporting purposes.
Advanced Window Functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()).
Dynamic SQL using EXEC (if using SQL Server) or PREPARE statements (in MySQL).
Role-based Access Control (RBAC) with GRANT & REVOKE.
Performance tuning (EXPLAIN ANALYZE, query optimization).
